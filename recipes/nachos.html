    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These breakfast nachos are a play on steak and eggs and they're out of this world. 
        Salty tortilla chips are layered with sliced seared flat iron steak, eggs, beans, and 
        cheese, broiled, dressed with everything else nacho, 
        then finished with a zingy chimichurri sauce.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>
            For chimichurri: Place cilantro, parsley, garlic, vinegar, crushed red pepper, 
            and salt in a small food processor; pulse until
             finely chopped, about 10 pulses. With processor running, 
            pour oil through food chute, and process until 
            fully incorporated, about 20 seconds; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            For steak: Sprinkle steak evenly with 1/2 teaspoon 
            of the salt, 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper, and cumin, as desired. 
            Heat a medium cast-iron skillet over medium-high for 5 minutes. Add steak 
            and 1 tablespoon of the oil, swirling to distribute oil evenly. Cook, undisturbed, 
            until nicely browned and a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of steak registers 
            120 degreed F (49 degrees ) for rare, about 3 
            minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board, and let rest 10 minutes. 
            Do not wipe skillet clean.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, whisk together eggs and remaining 1/4 teaspoon 
            each salt and black pepper in a medium bowl until thoroughly blended. 
            Heat cast-iron skillet over medium. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and eggs; 
            cook, stirring occasionally, until just set, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a bowl; 
            cover, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven’s broiler and place a rack about 
            12 inches from the heat source. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble nachos, arrange half of tortilla chips in an even layer on prepared baking sheet. 
            Thinly slice steak across the grain, and cut into 3/4-inch pieces. Sprinkle tortilla chips 
            evenly with half of steak, half of beans, half of eggs, 
            and half of Mexican blend cheese. Repeat with remaining chips, steak, beans, eggs, and cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Broil until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 2 minutes. 
            Top with tomatoes, avocado, and pickled jalapeños. Drizzle evenly with 
            chimichurri, and serve with sour cream.
